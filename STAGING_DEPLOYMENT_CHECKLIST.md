# 🚀 Staging Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Security Validation

### ✅ Completed Security Measures
- [x] SecurityUtils framework implemented
- [x] SecurityConfig production policies created  
- [x] PostMessage origin validation added
- [x] Hardcoded secrets eliminated
- [x] XSS prevention tests created
- [x] Input validation patterns defined

### 🔍 Required Security Validation

#### 1. Static Analysis
```bash
# Must show 0 high/critical vulnerabilities
npm run security:scan
```

#### 2. Dependency Security  
```bash
# Must show 0 vulnerable dependencies
npm audit --audit-level high
```

#### 3. XSS Prevention Tests
```bash
# Must pass all security tests
npm run test:security
```

#### 4. Content Security Policy
- [ ] CSP headers configured in staging environment
- [ ] Script sources whitelisted and validated
- [ ] Inline script policies reviewed

### 🎯 Staging Environment Setup

#### Infrastructure Requirements
- [ ] PostgreSQL database with staging data
- [ ] Redis cache configured
- [ ] Environment variables set
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates installed
- [ ] Error monitoring enabled

#### Application Configuration
- [ ] All API endpoints functional
- [ ] WebSocket connections stable
- [ ] PWA manifest accessible
- [ ] Service worker caching verified

### 🧪 Comprehensive Test Execution

#### Unit Tests
```bash
npm test # Target: 256+ tests passing
```

#### End-to-End Tests  
```bash
npm run test:e2e # Target: 100% critical path coverage
```

#### Security Tests
```bash
npm run test:security # Target: All XSS prevention tests passing
```

#### Performance Tests
```bash
npm run test:performance # Target: <200ms response time
```

### 📊 Success Criteria

#### Security Standards (BLOCKING)
- ✅ Zero high/critical security vulnerabilities
- ⚠️ Zero medium XSS vulnerabilities (In Progress)
- ✅ All secrets externalized to environment variables
- ✅ Input validation comprehensive

#### Quality Standards
- ✅ 99%+ test coverage maintained
- ✅ Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ Zero linting violations
- ✅ Clean dependency audit

#### Performance Standards
- Response time < 200ms for search operations
- Page load time < 2 seconds  
- WebSocket connection stability > 99%
- Mobile performance score > 90

### 🔄 Deployment Process

1. **Final Security Scan**
   ```bash
   npm run security:final-check
   ```

2. **Build Production Assets**
   ```bash
   npm run build:production
   ```

3. **Deploy to Staging**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:staging
   ```

4. **Smoke Tests**
   ```bash
   npm run test:staging-smoke
   ```

### 🚨 Rollback Plan

If any security or critical functionality issues are discovered:

1. Immediate rollback via deployment script
2. Investigation and fix in development
3. Re-run complete validation pipeline
4. Re-deploy with fixes

**IMPORTANT**: Do not proceed to staging without resolving all XSS vulnerabilities.
Security is a blocking requirement for staging deployment.
