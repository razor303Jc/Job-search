## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Fixed Issues
1. **XSS Prevention Test**: Resolved DOM environment compatibility in Node.js
2. **Security Test Integration**: Added proper vitest imports and mocking
3. **Pipeline Dependencies**: Configured proper test execution order
4. **Performance Test Setup**: Application startup automation

### New NPM Scripts Added
```json
{
  "test:security": "vitest run --reporter=verbose tests/security",
  "test:performance:quick": "node tests/performance/performance-test-suite.js quick",
  "test:performance:standard": "node tests/performance/performance-test-suite.js standard",
  "test:performance:comprehensive": "node tests/performance/performance-test-suite.js comprehensive"
}
```

### CI/CD Enhancements
- **Multi-tier testing**: Basic → Comprehensive → E2E
- **Environment-specific**: Development, staging, production workflows
- **Artifact management**: Performance reports, coverage reports, test results
- **Auto-merge workflows**: dev → stage → main with quality gates

## 📋 Pipeline Flow

### Development Branch (`dev`)
1. Quality checks (unit, integration, security, quick performance)
2. Auto-create PR to `stage` on success
3. Deploy to development environment

### Staging Branch (`stage`)
1. Full quality checks
2. Comprehensive testing (performance, Selenium)
3. E2E testing
4. Build and containerize
5. Auto-create PR to `main` on success
6. Deploy to staging environment

### Main Branch (`main`)
1. All testing phases
2. Production deployment
3. Release versioning
