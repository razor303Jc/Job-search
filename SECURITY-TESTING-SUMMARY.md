- **Purpose**: Dynamic application security testing (DAST)
- **Results**: ✅ **Baseline scan completed successfully**
- **Command**: `npm run test:zap`
- **Integration**: Comprehensive testing phase

#### 3. **Custom Security Tests**
- **Purpose**: Application-specific security validation
- **Coverage**: XSS prevention, input validation, rate limiting, CSRF protection
- **Results**: ✅ **6/6 security tests passed**
- **Command**: `npm run test:security`
- **Integration**: All CI/CD branches

#### 4. **Comprehensive Security Test Suite**
- **Tool**: Custom Node.js security orchestrator
- **Purpose**: Coordinates all security testing tools
- **Features**: 
  - Automated report generation (JSON + HTML)
