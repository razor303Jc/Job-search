## Component Architecture

### ExportSharingComponent Class Structure
```typescript
class ExportSharingComponent {
  private ws: WebSocket | null = null;
  private reportTemplates: ReportTemplate[] = [];
  private jobCollections: JobCollection[] = [];
  private exportQueue: Array<ExportQueueItem> = [];

  // Core Methods
  constructor()
  setWebSocket(ws: WebSocket): void
  private handleWebSocketMessage(data: any): void
  private initializeEventListeners(): void
  
  // UI Rendering
  private renderExportInterface(): void
  private renderSharingInterface(): void
  private renderReportTemplates(): void
  private renderJobCollections(): void
  
  // Export Operations
  private async handleExportSubmission(): Promise<void>
  private async quickExport(format: ExportOptions['format']): Promise<void>
  private addToExportQueue(exportId: string): void
}
```

### Interface Definitions
- `ExportOptions` - Export configuration and format options
- `ShareOptions` - Sharing permissions and recipient management
- `ReportTemplate` - Scheduled report template system
- `JobCollection` - Organized job groupings for export

## Recommendations for Next Stage

### Stage 5: Advanced Filtering & Sorting UI
Based on the successful completion of Stage 4, the following recommendations are made for Stage 5:

1. **Filter Integration**: Leverage the export component's field selection logic for advanced filtering
2. **Sort Performance**: Implement efficient sorting algorithms for large datasets
3. **UI Consistency**: Maintain the same design language and accessibility standards
4. **Real-time Updates**: Use the established WebSocket infrastructure for live filter results
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Extend the responsive design patterns to complex filter interfaces

### Technical Debt
- ✅ No significant technical debt identified
- ✅ Code quality standards maintained
- ✅ Documentation complete and up-to-date
- ✅ Test coverage comprehensive
