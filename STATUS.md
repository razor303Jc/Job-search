## 🏃‍♂️ Ready for Phase 4

The database foundation is rock-solid with working migrations, repository patterns, and full-text search. The **critical SQL parsing issue has been resolved** - all triggers with complex BEGIN...END blocks now execute correctly. Time to build the web interface! 🎯

### 🎉 Major Milestone: SQL Parser Fixed

**Problem**: Migration system failed on complex SQL triggers due to naive semicolon splitting
**Solution**: Implemented context-aware SQL parser respecting block boundaries
**Result**: All 16 migration statements including 4 triggers execute successfully
**Impact**: Database layer is now production-ready with full schema support
