# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Next Steps

## 🎯 What to Work on Next

Based on our current setup, here are the **immediate next steps** in order of priority:

### 1. Configuration System (Start Here!)

#### Estimated Time for Config Reporting: 2-3 hours

```bash
# Files to create:
touch src/config/index.ts
touch src/config/schemas.ts
touch src/config/dorks.ts
touch src/config/sites.ts
```

**What it does:**

- Loads and validates environment configuration
- Defines Google Dork patterns for job searches
- Configures supported job sites and their scraping rules

### 2. Base Scraper Implementation

#### Estimated Time for Base Scraper: 3-4 hours

```bash
# Files to create:
touch src/scrapers/base-scraper.ts
touch src/utils/rate-limiter.ts
touch tests/unit/scrapers.test.ts
```

**What it does:**

- Abstract base class for all scrapers
- Rate limiting and retry logic
- Error handling and metrics collection

### 3. Google Search Functionality

#### Estimated Time: 4-5 hours

```bash
# Files to create:
touch src/scrapers/google-scraper.ts
touch src/scrapers/cheerio-scraper.ts
touch tests/unit/google-scraper.test.ts
```

**What it does:**

- Execute Google Dork searches
- Parse search results for job listing URLs
- Handle pagination and rate limiting

### 4. Job Data Parsing

#### Estimated Time: 3-4 hours

```bash
# Files to create:
touch src/parsers/job-parser.ts
touch src/parsers/schemas/job.schema.ts
touch tests/unit/job-parser.test.ts
```

**What it does:**

- Extract job information from scraped pages
- Normalize and validate job data
- Handle different site formats

### 5. Basic Reporting

#### Estimated Time for Generators: 2-3 hours

```bash
# Files to create:
touch src/generators/json-generator.ts
touch src/generators/csv-generator.ts
touch tests/unit/generators.test.ts
```

**What it does:**

- Export scraped jobs to JSON and CSV
- Data formatting and validation
- File writing utilities

## 🎮 How to Start

### Option 1: Start with Configuration (Recommended)

```bash
# Let's begin with the config system
cd /home/jc/Documents/Job-search
touch src/config/index.ts

# Then implement step by step:
# 1. Config loader
# 2. Base scraper
# 3. Google scraper
# 4. Job parser
# 5. Report generators
```

### Option 2: Test-Driven Development

```bash
# Start by writing tests first
touch tests/unit/config.test.ts
touch tests/unit/scrapers.test.ts

# Write failing tests, then implement features
npm run test:watch
```

---

## 🧪 Testing as You Go

After each implementation:

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Check build
npm run build

# Test CLI
npm run dev

# Lint and format
npm run lint:fix
```

## 📝 Implementation Tips

### For Configuration System

- Use Zod for schema validation
- Support both .env and JSON config files
- Include sensible defaults
- Validate required vs optional fields

### For Scrapers

- Start with Cheerio for static content
- Add proper error handling
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
- Respect robots.txt and rate limits

### For Parsers

- Use regex for salary extraction
- Handle multiple date formats
- Normalize job titles and locations
- Score parsing confidence

### For Generators

- Stream large datasets to CSV
- Add metadata to reports
- Support custom column selection
- Handle special characters properly

## 🎯 Success Criteria

After completing these 5 steps, you should have:

1. ✅ A working CLI command: `npm run dev search --keywords "node.js developer" --format json`
2. ✅ Configuration loaded from environment and files
3. ✅ Basic Google Dork search functionality
4. ✅ Job data extraction from search results
5. ✅ Export results to JSON and CSV files
6. ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
7. ✅ Clean, linted, and formatted code

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Start small**: Get one site working well before adding others
- **Test frequently**: Run tests after each major change
- **Use the debugger**: VS Code has excellent TypeScript debugging
- **Check logs**: Use the logger we set up to trace issues
- **Commit often**: Small, focused commits are easier to review

---

## 🆘 When You Get Stuck

1. **Check the logs**: Look for error messages in the console
2. **Run tests**: See what's failing with `npm test`
3. **Build check**: Ensure TypeScript compiles with `npm run build`
4. **Reference the plan**: Check `plan.md` for architectural guidance
5. **Look at similar projects**: Search GitHub for "job scraper" examples
